            <p>Poultry farming plays a crucial role in global food security, but the industry faces significant challenges due to various chicken diseases that can lead to high mortality rates and economic losses. Early and accurate detection of these diseases is critical for effective management and control. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify and detect chicken diseases from images. By leveraging the power of CNNs, our model automatically extracts features from chicken images and classifies them into various disease categories, such as Newcastle disease, fowl pox, and coccidiosis.</p>
            <p>The proposed method uses a large dataset of labelled chicken images, achieving high accuracy in disease detection. The system provides an efficient, automated solution for farmers and veterinarians to identify diseases early, facilitating prompt treatment and reducing the spread of infections. Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-based model outperforms traditional image classification techniques, offering a robust and scalable solution for the poultry industry.</p>

            <p>Animal agriculture is extremely important to the worldâ€™s rising population. Animal products provide nutrient-dense meals that help people of all ages stay healthy in communities all over the world. The agriculture business must continue to improve its efficiency and quantity of production as human demand for animal proteins increases. The most common chicken diseases include salmonella infections, coccidiosis, and Newcastle disease.</p>
            <p>The research of computer vision, image processing, and pattern recognition has made substantial progress during the past several decades. Nowadays, due to availability of large amounts of data and sophisticated algorithms such as deep learning, researchers and industries are employing the technique to solve a variety of problems ranging from simple object detection to complex scene understanding.</p>
            <p>The analysis of chicken droppings by image processing and deep learning for sick bird detection is reported. However, the study is limited to detecting the abnormality of the fecal image and does not detect the presence of a disease directly. Similarly, a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed to diagnose poultry diseases by classifying healthy and unhealthy fecal images with deep learning.</p>
